Write a blog on difference between documents & windows objects

1.Foundations of Web Content: Documents, typically in the form of HTML files, serve as the fundamental building blocks of web content. They define the structure, layout, and presentation of information displayed in web browsers.

2.DOM Representation: Documents are represented in the browser environment through the Document Object Model (DOM), a hierarchical tree structure that provides a structured representation of the document's elements, allowing for programmatic manipulation via scripting languages like JavaScript.

3.Browser Environment Gateway: Window objects act as the gateway to the broader browser environment. Each browser window or tab corresponds to a window object, encapsulating not only the document being displayed but also various browser functionalities and properties.

4.Global Scope: Window objects serve as the global scope for JavaScript code executing within the browser environment. They provide access to global functions, variables, and objects, facilitating cross-document communication and interaction.

5.Browser Interactions: Window objects enable interactions with the browser, including operations such as navigation (changing URLs), handling browser events (resizing, closing), and accessing browser features (localStorage, sessionStorage).

6.Cross-Origin Communication: Window objects facilitate secure communication between documents from different origins (e.g., different domains, protocols, or ports) through mechanisms like postMessage(), enabling cross-origin interactions while mitigating security risks.

7.DOM Manipulation: JavaScript code running within the context of a window object can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) hierarchy, dynamically updating the content and appearance of the associated document in response to user actions or application log
